For most of my life, I have classified myself strictly as a laboratory scientist.
During my time as an undergraduate at the Caltech, then later as an industry
research scientist, and finally as a graduate student at the University of
Washington, I captured snapshots of chemical reactions, built and designed
chemicals and gels for smart windows, and created nanomaterials for thinner and lighter
electronics.


## From science to data science

In the middle of a Ph.D program in materials science and engineering at the
University of Washington, I earned a one-year, fully funded [data science
training fellowship](http://depts.washington.edu/uwdirect/) supported by the
[UW eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/). Though the
program was intended to help scientists use data science as a toolbox to
advance their research, I fell in love with the versatility and power of the
tools themselves.

To learn more, I took advanced data science courses at
UW and worked on innovative projects in collaborations with data scientists at
the [University of Washington](http://www.rezahosseinighomi.com/projects.html) and the
[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/computing/data/index.stm).
We're currently preparing manuscripts for these projects, and I'm excited to
share my contributions to the academic data science community soon. (Stay tuned!)
