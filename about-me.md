## Summary

* Data scientist in computational biology and cheminformatics research!
  - Basically, my job is to digest (_sorry, couldn't resist_) huge analytical
    datasets into information about molecules, whether structure- or activity-related
    in nature.
* Studied materials science and engineering, data science, and chemistry
  - A (stringently air- and water-free) piece of my heart still lies in
    inorganic chemistry and nanomaterials ‚ù§

## Past Projects

* Some cool projects I've worked on:
  * Developing models for targeted protein sequence analysis
  * Building automated tools for smart reference library generation (_over 10x faster than a human expert!_)
  * Predicting chemical transformations using a language-based modeling approach
  * Using a recurrent neural network to predict whether or not Parkinson's disease
    patients are consistently taking their medication (_max accuracy ~60%_)
- I also love the software development side of my job (mostly Python, some R)
  and have accidentally contributed to open-source tools as a result.
  Most are not yet public, but I hope to share them on GitHub soon!

## Hobbies, Social Media, and Other Fluff

* For fun, I love reading (_favorite authors: Margaret Atwood and Kazuo Ishiguro_),
  drawing (_and recently, watercolor painting!_), solving puzzles (_insert clever flavor text here_),
  and exploring new places and foods of all kinds!
* Here are some of my online profiles:
  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chjchang/)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/christinehc) (_no ongoing personal projects at the moment, unfortunately_)
