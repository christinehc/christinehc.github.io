I am a data scientist specializing in computational biology and cheminformatics.
My job is to _digest_ (ha) huge analytical datasets into critical
information bout molecules, whether structure- or activity-related in nature.

<!-- My background is in materials science and engineering, data science, and chemistry.
A stringently air- and water-free piece of my heart still lies in inorganic chemistry and nanomaterials ❤ -->

## Past Projects

Some cool projects I've worked on:

* Developing models for targeted protein sequence analysis
* Building automated tools for smart reference library generation (_over 10x faster than a human expert!_)
* Predicting chemical transformations using a language-based modeling approach
* Using a recurrent neural network to predict whether or not Parkinson's disease
  patients are consistently taking their medication (_max accuracy ~60%_)
