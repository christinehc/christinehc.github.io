I am a data scientist specializing in computational biology and cheminformatics.
My job is to digest (_couldn't resist_) huge analytical datasets into critical
information bout molecules, whether structure- or activity-related in nature.

My background is in materials science and engineering, data science, and chemistry.
A stringently air- and water-free piece of my heart still lies in inorganic chemistry and nanomaterials ‚ù§

## Past Projects

* Some cool projects I've worked on:
  * Developing models for targeted protein sequence analysis
  * Building automated tools for smart reference library generation (_over 10x faster than a human expert!_)
  * Predicting chemical transformations using a language-based modeling approach
  * Using a recurrent neural network to predict whether or not Parkinson's disease
    patients are consistently taking their medication (_max accuracy ~60%_)

## Hobbies, Social Media, and Other Fluff

* For fun, I love reading (_favorite authors: Margaret Atwood and Kazuo Ishiguro_),
  drawing (_and recently, watercolor painting!_), solving puzzles (_insert clever flavor text here_),
  and exploring new places and foods of all kinds!
* Here are some of my online profiles:
