## Projects

DarkChem
* (manuscript in preparation)
* Python (Jupyter, pandas, numpy, sklearn)

Visualizing How Parkinson's Disease Affects Walking
* Python (pandas, altair/vega-lite), JavaScript (D3.js), signal processing

[SEAnimals: Visualizing Pets in Seattle](cse512-19s.github.io/A3-SEAnimals/)
* Compiled and processed data (pandas, altair) from multiple public sources into
 streamlined dataset
* Sketched preliminary dashboards with Tableau
* Used JavaScript (\texttt{D3.js}, Vega-Lite) to create and publish an
interactive visualization of pet licensing information in the city of Seattle.

[PaperParser: Text Mining for Solar Cell Literature](github.com/paper-parser/)
* Developed a Python package to automatically read scientific papers on
perovskite solar cells. Imported and cleaned text (bs4, pandas), classified
sentences using a linear SVM (sklearn), and built domain-specific Named Entity
Recognition to identify n-gram tokens (re, spaCy).
* Led a 4-person team. Established use cases, delegated responsibilities, met
deadlines, and presented work at a poster session. Used version control (Git)
and continuous integration (Travis) to build and deploy code.
